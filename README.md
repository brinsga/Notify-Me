# Notify Me

I'd like to collect information from different data points that I care about and notify via slack when an event of interest occures.

1. Notify Trending Books

Being a book enthusiast, I don't feel good about missing the current trending books. So, I designed this trending book notifier script which connects with New York Times Best Seller Books API and runs once a day to fetch new information and notifies me

Programming Language: Python
Database: SQLite
API's - NYT Books API, Slack Messaging API


2. Notify Today's USPS Mails

### Goal:
 
I'd like to ideally package these different notify me scripts so that anyone could download and run it on their machine.
