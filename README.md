# TrendingBookNotifier

Being a book enthusiast, I don't feel good about missing information about the current trending books. In order to make sure that I don't miss information about the books that I would care, I designed this trending book notifier application which connects with New York Best Seller Books API and runs once a day to fetch new information and send a slack notification. 

Programming Language: Python
Database: SQLite
API's - NYT Books API, Slack Messaging API
